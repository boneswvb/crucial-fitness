      <h2>Analysis of the Market</h2>
      <Media>
        <Media.Body>
          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The level of competition is high with many Physical Therapists that have been in the
            industry for a long time and their level of experience is high compared to
            Crucial Fitness. My competitors’ strength is the fact that they are well connected
            with teams, doctors, and coaches. Their weaknesses are only working on the current
            injury and not the origin which led to the injury, being the athletes’
            “go-to-therapist”. That is where Crucial Fitness will be overtaking them.
