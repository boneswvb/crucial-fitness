          <h2>What is Coaching in Sport?</h2>
          <sub><a href="https://www.topendsports.com" target="blank">Info from Topend Sports</a></sub>
          <p>
            Sports coaches assist athletes in developing to their full potential. They are
            responsible for training athletes in a sport by analyzing their performances,
            instructing in relevant skills and by providing encouragement. But you are also
            responsible for the guidance of the athlete in life and their chosen sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, the role of the coach will be many and varied, from instructor,
            assessor, friend, mentor, facilitator, chauffeur, demonstrator, adviser,
            supporter, fact finder, motivator, counselor, organizer, planner and the
            Fountain of all Knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            In relation to sports, the role of the coach is to create the right conditions
            for learning to happen and to find ways of motivating the athletes. Most athletes
            are highly motivated and therefore the task is to maintain that motivation and to
            generate excitement and enthusiasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coach will need to be able to: assist athletes to prepare training programs,
            communicate effectively with athletes, assist athletes to develop new skills,
            use evaluation tests to monitor training progress and predict performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, you can see that it is a very difficult task and
            requires a very special person.

          <h2> What is a personal trainer?</h2>
          <p><strong>A personal trainer …</strong></p>
          <h3>1. Understands enough about the human body to get a result</h3>
          <p>
            That is, you know how to impose a level of stress that helps a client lose fat,
            increase strength, or improve in something that matters to the client.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Typically starts with just one tool in the bag.</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re a powerlifter, you have all your clients work with a barbell. If you’re
            a CrossFitter, all your clients are going to do box jumps and kettlebell swings.
            If you’re a bodybuilder, your clients will get lots of muscle-isolation work with
            dumbbells and machines.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Talks nonstop.</h3>
          <p>
            You count every rep aloud, verbally correct every part of every exercise, and throw
            science around like a tennis ball. Most of all you encourage. Because everything is
            “awesome,” words like “good” or even “great” lose their value. The session becomes a
            giant word salad, confusing and distracting the client and diminishing the value of
            your own cues.
          </p>
          <h3>What is a fitness coach?</h3>
          <p>
            A fitness coach, more than anything else, understands the difference between what a
            client wants and what that client needs. She identifies the underlying issues that
            prevent a client from achieving her stated goals, and knows how to solve those
            problems.
          </p>
          <p><strong>The most effectives coaches do that in three important ways.</strong></p>
          <h3>Fitness coaching key</h3>
          <p><strong>#1: Say more by saying less</strong></p>
          <p>
            In my early days, I never passed up a chance to give a client a motivational speech,
            or to launch into an explanation of energy systems. Sometimes it worked. Some clients
            needed that extra shot of inspiration to get their juices flowing. Some wanted to
            know what was going on beneath the hood, and why we were doing something one way
            instead of another way. More often, the response was confusion. I got a lot of blank
            stares back then. And I’m sure I responded with blank stares of my own. Like, how
            could they not get fired up by my “clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose” pep talk?
            How are they not fascinated by my masterful lecture on exercise science? But then I
            noticed something: When I stopped talking, clients paid attention. They assumed I
            wanted to say something, and the longer I held off saying it, the more important it
            must be. Now I may not say anything while a client works. I’ll wait until the end of
            the set, when I’ll compliment something specific (“I like the way you generated
            power through the hips on those last two reps”) and offer a simple cue for the next
            set (“this time we’re going to lift the chest a little higher and tuck those
            shoulder blades into your back pockets”).
          </p>
          <p>I’m not suggesting you take a vow of silence. That would be weird.</p>
          <p><strong>But I am making these points:</strong></p>
          <ListGroup as="ul">
            <ListGroup.Item as="li">• The fewer compliments you give, the more excited your clients will be to receive them.</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item as="li">
              • If you wait for a client to ask for an explanation, the client is more likely to
              appreciate and perhaps even be impressed by your answer.
              Or, to put it more simply, the less you say, the more value it will have.
            </ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item as="li">• The fewer cues you offer, the harder your clients will work to implement them.</ListGroup.Item>
          </ListGroup>
          <p><strong>#2: Notice what other trainers miss</strong></p>
          <p>
            When a personal trainer watches a client squat, it’s usually from one angle, focusing
            on one aspect of the movement. Does the back stay flat? Are the knees staying over
            the toes? If he sees a problem, that’s what he cues: “Knees out.” “Back flat.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A fitness coach, meanwhile, figures out why the client’s form is off, or why certain
            movements might be painful. That doesn’t happen overnight. It takes years of studying
            anatomy and physiology, reading textbooks until your eyes bleed and your brain turns
            to slush. And then watching the client’s entire movement chain, rather than assuming
            a problem begins and ends in the joint where you happen to observe it, or where the
            client feels pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose I see the client’s knee slip into valgus, for example. I’ll look at his ankle,
            see it wobble, and cue the client to push through the heel instead of his big toe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>#3: Listen to what the clients want, but give them what they need</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Let’s say a client comes to the gym with the classic goal of losing weight.</p>
          <p>
            If you’re a personal trainer, your first instinct is to attack the goal
            head-on. You’ll work the client in a way that burns as many calories as possible in
            the time you have together. And you’ll probably speed up the weight loss by giving
            her the most restrictive diet she can handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could very well work. For a while. But it’s only a matter of time before the
            client’s willpower wears down, or she gets hurt, or she just gets tired of being so
            tired after every workout.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fitness coach, meanwhile, understands that the better a client moves, the more
            she’ll enjoy moving. That’s why the coach focuses on strength and skill
            acquisition. Instead of turning the client into a quivering puddle of sweat workout
            after workout, week after week, the coach begins with competence in the fundamental
            movement patterns. Then she increases the client’s strength on exercises within each
            movement pattern.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Finally, she changes the client’s mental approach to nutrition.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Instead of focusing on what not to eat if she wants to lose weight, the coach
            encourages her to think about what she should eat to get the best results from their
            workouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diet could be exactly the same—more lean protein, more vegetables, fewer highly
            processed foods with added sugars and fats—but the coach flips the script in the
            client’s mind. Good food choices are about performance and function, not about
            restriction or punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know it’s working when your weight-loss client shows up on Monday talking about
            how much she enjoyed the hike she took over the weekend. How strong she felt on the
            trail, even while climbing hills or scrambling over rocks. And how good she felt
            afterwards, without the knee pain she used to experience if she walked up a flight
            of stairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now she isn’t someone who merely endures exercise. She enjoys it. A client who
            enjoys movement will reward you with compliance, and with compliance you get results.
          </p>
