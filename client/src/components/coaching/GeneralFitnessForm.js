          <p>
            There are many benefits to increasing one’s general fitness level,
            such as a reduction in stress, to feel better, a decreased
            likelihood of contracting many cardiovascular diseases, etc..
            Implementing or emphasizing an increased consistent level of
            physical activity is a surefire way to increase general fitness
            levels. The amount that one must be active and in doing what varies
            from person to person; for example, LeBron James has a much
            different training regimen than Judge Judy.

            There are also many ways to decrease one’s general fitness level.
            Injury, stress, tragedy, all of these can cause one to become less
            active and decreasing your body’s BMR. A general reduction in
            physical activity will also absolutely cause a decrease in general
            fitness.

          <h2>Fitness and Mental Stability</h2>
          <p>
            Physical fitness and mental stability go hand in hand, as research
            suggests that although physical and aerobic activity betters ones
            physical capabilities, it also helps with ones positive body image
            and self esteem. Studies show that physical fitness helps improve
            positive body image and self esteem, perceivable increased stress
            management, reduction of depression and anxiety,[3] as well as
            enhance mood states and improve overall cognitive function.[1] This
            all further shows the importance behind the usage of physical
            fitness for mental stability and why it is so important to engage in
            the practice of it.

          <h2>Weight loss and Muscle Definition</h2>
          <p>
            General fitness training may be used to promote weight loss.
            Personal trainers construct a program centered on restructuring
            lifestyle while helping to provide the necessary motivation for its
            success. General fitness training can also be used to promote toning
            or building of muscles, which are essentially the same physiological
            process. (However, &#39;toning&#39; implies moderate muscle
            definition, whereas &#39;building&#39; implies increasing
            musculature significantly.) The definition of weight loss is losing
            as much as or more than 3% body weight, although there is no
            completely defined definition as to what weight loss is, as one must
            take into account expert opinion, body type, previous study
            precedents, and normal weight fluctuations.
          </p>
          <h2>Diet ( fitness for weight loss)</h2>
          <p>
            Diet itself helps to increase calorie burning by boosting
            metabolism, a process further enhanced while gaining more lean
            muscle. An aerobic exercise program can burn fat and increase the
            basal metabolic rate (BMR) in obese adults, studies show that
            through proper diet over the span of 6 months in obese adults has
            shown a positive correlation in fitness and mood, as well as a
            weight loss average of over 27.5%[1] Studies also show reduced level
            of hunger and several other symptoms, such as inability to get up in
            the morning and frequent anxiety.[2]

          <h2>Sports-Specific Training</h2>
          <p>
            Sports-specific trainers can help improve strength, flexibility and
            stamina to improve performance in specific sports. Options include
            increasing arm strength for tennis playing or improve strength and
            core stability providing better balance playing golf. Sports
            specific training is all about developing physical conditions to
            improve performance and skills at a particular sport. Also,
            understanding the needs of the game, training/practicing at the
            correct pace, in order to meet sports requirements.
          </p>
          <h2>Injury recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Certified personal trainers can contribute significantly and
            uniquely to recovery and rehabilitation efforts. But personal
            trainers mainly pick up where physical therapy leaves off.
