            There are many benefits to increasing one’s general fitness level, such as a reduction
            in stress, to feel better, a decreased likelihood of contracting many
            cardiovascular diseases, etc.. Implementing or emphasizing an increased consistent
            level of physical activity is a surefire way to increase general fitness levels. The
            amount that one must be active and in doing what varies from person to person; for
            example, LeBron James has a much different training regimen than Judge Judy.

            There are also many ways to decrease one’s general fitness level. Injury, stress,
            tragedy, all of these can cause one to become less active and decreasing your
            body’s BMR. A general reduction in physical activity will also absolutely cause
            a decrease in general fitness.

            Fitness and Mental Stability
          </h2>
          <p>
            Physical fitness and mental stability go hand in hand, as research suggests that
            although physical and aerobic activity betters ones physical capabilities, it
            also helps with ones positive body image and self esteem. Studies show that physical
            fitness helps improve positive body image and self esteem, perceivable increased
            stress management, reduction of depression and anxiety,[3] as well as enhance mood
            states and improve overall cognitive function.[1] This all further shows the importance
            behind the usage of physical fitness for mental stability and why it is so important to
            engage in the practice of it.

            Weight loss and Muscle Definition
          </h2>
          <p>
            General fitness training may be used to promote weight loss. Personal trainers construct
            a program centered on restructuring lifestyle while helping to provide the necessary
            motivation for its success.
            General fitness training can also be used to promote toning or building of muscles,
            which are essentially the same physiological process. (However, &#39;toning&#39; implies
            moderate muscle definition, whereas &#39;building&#39; implies increasing musculature
            significantly.)
            The definition of weight loss is losing as much as or more than 3% body weight,
            although there is no completely defined definition as to what weight loss is,
            as one must take into account expert opinion, body type, previous study precedents, and
            normal weight fluctuations.

          <h2>
            Diet ( fitness for weight loss)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Diet itself helps to increase calorie burning by boosting metabolism, a process further
            enhanced while gaining more lean muscle. An aerobic exercise program can burn fat and
            increase the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in obese adults, studies show that through
            proper diet over the span of 6 months in obese adults has shown a positive correlation
            in fitness and mood, as well as a weight loss average of over 27.5%[1]  Studies also
            show reduced level of hunger and several other symptoms, such as inability to get up
            in the morning and frequent anxiety.[2]

          <h2>Sports-Specific Training</h2>
          <p>
            Sports-specific trainers can help improve strength, flexibility and stamina to improve
            performance in specific sports. Options include increasing arm strength for tennis
            playing or improve strength and core stability providing better balance playing golf.
            Sports specific training is all about developing physical conditions to improve
            performance and skills at a particular sport. Also, understanding the needs of the
            game, training/practicing at the correct pace, in order to meet sports requirements.
          </p>
          <h2>Injury recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Certified personal trainers can contribute significantly and uniquely to recovery and
            rehabilitation efforts. But personal trainers mainly pick up where physical therapy
            leaves off.
