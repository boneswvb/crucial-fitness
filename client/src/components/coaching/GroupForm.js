          <h2>What Is Group Fitness?</h2>
          <p>
            Any form of fitness, which is done in a group setting and lead by an
            instructor or a trainer, can fall under the group fitness category.
            Class formats can be based on cardio, strength, core, or any
            combination of the three. The leader of your class will point you in
            the right direction, but choosing which class to attend is
            completely up to you. Whatever your goal may be, group fitness can
            help you get there.

            What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Group Fitness Training?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most people would agree that having a personal trainer would
            positively impact their fitness goals. The drawback for many,
            however, is that having a coach one-on-one can be expensive or
            intimidating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Training in a group fixes these problems. Many fitness centers have
            a group class schedule with an abundance of free or discounted
            offerings. These classes provide participants with specialized
            instruction for little-to-no cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working out in a group setting also allows participants to meet and
            interact with other people who have similar goals. As friendships
            form, a sense of accountability develops between everyone. This
            motivates individuals to not skip their workout, which helps them
            reach their goals faster. While anyone can benefit from group
            classes, they may not be the right fit for everyone. For example, if
            someone is starting to exercise for the first time in their life, it
            might be intimidating to be in a crowd trying to step-touch to the
            32-count of the instructor’s latest playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safety can also be a concern for first-time participants. Many
            classes are attended by regulars who are aware of proper form and do
            not need individualized instruction. If a person is not familiar
            with most exercise movements, he or she might see more benefit from
            the one-on-one attention given by a personal trainer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the choice of whether or not to attend a group fitness
            class should be based on a person’s goals, familiarity with
            exercise, and comfort level exercising within a crowd of people.
