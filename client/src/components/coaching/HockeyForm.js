      <h1>Hockey Coaching</h1>
      <Media>
        <Media.Body>
          <p>
            A hockey training program must meet the demands of a very physically challenging,
            multi-sprint sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Played on a similar sized pitch with the same number of players and for a similar
            duration, physiologically field hockey is a close match in many ways to soccer. While
            intermittent in nature, players must perform continuously for 70 minutes with just
            one 5-10 minute interval. This places a high demand on the aerobic system and good
            aerobic endurance is required to support repetitive bouts of high intensity exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anaerobic power and anaerobic endurance is high in elite hockey players. Although the
            majority of the game is spent in low-level activity such as walking and light jogging,
            repeated back-to-back sprints make speed and tolerance to lactic acid an important
            characteristic in players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strength is also central to a hockey training program. Although players aren’t required
            to hold off physical challenges (when compared to other multi-sprint sports), power is
            required for acceleration, speed and quick changes in direction. Upper body strength
            allows players to shoot more powerfully and pass over a greater range of distances.
            The unique demands of the sport mean that strength endurance is just as crucial as
            explosive power. Careful planning is required to ensure that both muscular power
            and muscular endurance can be effectively developed alongside each other without
            leading to over-training and fatigue. Hockey conditioning also plays a crucial role
            in injury prevention…

          </p>
          <p>
            As the sport is played on a synthetic surface, this places different strains on the body
            compared to grass. While the principle of specificity would dictate that a hockey
            training program should mirror the game as closely as possible, in this case there may
            be good cause to argue against training exclusively on artificial turf. There is a
            greater injury risk inherent in playing on synthetic surfaces, in particular with
            respect to spinal shrinkage (3). Again, correct training can help to minimize any risk.

          <h2>Workout Routine for Field Hockey Players</h2>
          <p>
            Well rounded field hockey players have well rounded workouts. Strength, conditioning,
            and recovery all need to play a role when training for the season.
          </p>
          <h3>Strength Training</h3>
          <p>
            Weight Training is important for increasing your muscle strength. Field Hockey players
            need to be physically strong when competing on the field. If you don&#39t have access
            to a gym or weights, body weight workouts will do the trick! Incorporating exercises
            that strength your entire body is important. Squats, glute bridges, and lunges are good
            exercises to include when building a strong lower body base. When working on your upper
            body, push ups and triceps dips are great to add into your routine.
          </p>
          <h3>Conditioning</h3>
          <p>
            Field Hockey players need to have high levels of endurance to perform at an elite
            level. It is important when creating a conditioning workout to include both long
            distance and interval training. Adding long distance running or biking is a great way
            to build up the endurance to run back and forth on the field. Players should also
            include interval training to increase their quickness on the field. Field Hockey games
            require athletes to be quick and an agile. Interval sprint training is the best way to
            achieve this quickness for any athlete. To keep your workouts fun, alternate your
            workouts between long distance training and interval circuits.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovery</h3>
          <sub>By Paul Rogers (Personal Trainer)</sub>
          <p>
            Field hockey requires a combination of strength, speed, and endurance. Weight training
            can improve these qualities. How can you use a weight training program to improve
            field hockey performance?
          </p>
          <p>
            Field hockey requires excellent aerobic fitness to provide endurance for sustained
            effort, strength to hold position over the ball and to hit, push, and flick powerfully,
            and speed and agility for general play. Weight training can help you develop strength,
            endurance, and agility. You will also need to do aerobic and high-intensity anaerobic
            training as part of an integrated training program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerobic fitness means you can run at a moderate pace for a substantial time without
            getting too tired. Anaerobic exercise occurs at an even higher intensity in which
            your muscles have to burn internal energy sources rather than get energy from
            oxygen. Achieving anaerobic fitness means you can keep going longer at high
            intensities before your legs and body slow down.3 Both are important in hockey,
            especially if you are likely to play the whole or most of the game. When you optimize
            all these elements—strength, endurance, and agility—you can claim to be at peak fitness.
