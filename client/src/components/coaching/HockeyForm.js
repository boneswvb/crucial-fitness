      <h1>Hockey Coaching</h1>
      <Media>
        <Media.Body>
          <p>
            A hockey training program must meet the demands of a very physically
            challenging, multi-sprint sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Played on a similar sized pitch with the same number of players and
            for a similar duration, physiologically field hockey is a close
            match in many ways to soccer. While intermittent in nature, players
            must perform continuously for 70 minutes with just one 5-10 minute
            interval. This places a high demand on the aerobic system and good
            aerobic endurance is required to support repetitive bouts of high
            intensity exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anaerobic power and anaerobic endurance is high in elite hockey
            players. Although the majority of the game is spent in low-level
            activity such as walking and light jogging, repeated back-to-back
            sprints make speed and tolerance to lactic acid an important
            characteristic in players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strength is also central to a hockey training program. Although
            players aren’t required to hold off physical challenges (when
            compared to other multi-sprint sports), power is required for
            acceleration, speed and quick changes in direction. Upper body
            strength allows players to shoot more powerfully and pass over a
            greater range of distances. The unique demands of the sport mean
            that strength endurance is just as crucial as explosive power.
            Careful planning is required to ensure that both muscular power and
            muscular endurance can be effectively developed alongside each other
            without leading to over-training and fatigue. Hockey conditioning
            also plays a crucial role in injury prevention…
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sport is played on a synthetic surface, this places different
            strains on the body compared to grass. While the principle of
            specificity would dictate that a hockey training program should
            mirror the game as closely as possible, in this case there may be
            good cause to argue against training exclusively on artificial turf.
            There is a greater injury risk inherent in playing on synthetic
            surfaces, in particular with respect to spinal shrinkage (3). Again,
            correct training can help to minimize any risk.

          <h2>Workout Routine for Field Hockey Players</h2>
          <p>
            Well rounded field hockey players have well rounded workouts.
            Strength, conditioning, and recovery all need to play a role when
            training for the season.
          </p>
          <h3>Strength Training</h3>
          <p>
            Weight Training is important for increasing your muscle strength.
            Field Hockey players need to be physically strong when competing on
            the field. If you don&#39t have access to a gym or weights, body
            weight workouts will do the trick! Incorporating exercises that
            strength your entire body is important. Squats, glute bridges, and
            lunges are good exercises to include when building a strong lower
            body base. When working on your upper body, push ups and triceps
            dips are great to add into your routine.
          </p>
          <h3>Conditioning</h3>
          <p>
            Field Hockey players need to have high levels of endurance to
            perform at an elite level. It is important when creating a
            conditioning workout to include both long distance and interval
            training. Adding long distance running or biking is a great way to
            build up the endurance to run back and forth on the field. Players
            should also include interval training to increase their quickness on
            the field. Field Hockey games require athletes to be quick and an
            agile. Interval sprint training is the best way to achieve this
            quickness for any athlete. To keep your workouts fun, alternate your
            workouts between long distance training and interval circuits.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovery</h3>
          <sub>By Paul Rogers (Personal Trainer)</sub>
          <p>
            Field hockey requires a combination of strength, speed, and
            endurance. Weight training can improve these qualities. How can you
            use a weight training program to improve field hockey performance?
          </p>
          <p>
            Field hockey requires excellent aerobic fitness to provide endurance
            for sustained effort, strength to hold position over the ball and to
            hit, push, and flick powerfully, and speed and agility for general
            play. Weight training can help you develop strength, endurance, and
            agility. You will also need to do aerobic and high-intensity
            anaerobic training as part of an integrated training program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerobic fitness means you can run at a moderate pace for a
            substantial time without getting too tired. Anaerobic exercise
            occurs at an even higher intensity in which your muscles have to
            burn internal energy sources rather than get energy from oxygen.
            Achieving anaerobic fitness means you can keep going longer at high
            intensities before your legs and body slow down.3 Both are important
            in hockey, especially if you are likely to play the whole or most of
            the game. When you optimize all these elements—strength, endurance,
            and agility—you can claim to be at peak fitness.
