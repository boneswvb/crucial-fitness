      <h2>GROUP FITNESS VS INDIVIDUAL FITNESS</h2>
      <sub>Posted on March 15, 2017 by jteller</sub>
      <p>
        As human beings we have always done things in groups. We go to school in classrooms, we
        join sports teams or join clubs which are all group activities, however there are also
        many of us who think and work better individually. With this in mind some people will
        see better results in a group fitness session while other would get better results in
        an individual setting.
      </p>
      <h3>Benefits of Individual Training</h3>
      <p>
        Individual training works well for someone who need special attention. Sometimes, a
        previous knee or ankle injury requires some quality time with a professional trainer
        who can address their specific needs. These limitations can lead to poor performance
        in a group session where exercises are programmed for the group and not the
        individual. Benefits of Individual training may include:
      </p>
      <p><strong>A Better Start</strong></p>
      <p>
        As a beginner in the fitness world, having personal or targeted training is sometimes
        the best solution. Jumping into a group training session may cause anxiety because of
        oneâ€™s inability to keep up. By choosing to train individually at first, you learn the
        right exercises for your ability and gain advice from a professional. This leads to a
        positive first experience with fitness.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
      <p>
        When you work with a fitness trainer, you can achieve specific fitness goals, where they
        be to lose weight or gain muscle mass.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
      <p>
        Some individuals find it easier to work out by themselves than in a group because they have
        more motivation on their own. Group sessions at specific times can weigh people down and
        cause them to lose motivation.If this sounds like you, then working out at your own pace
        may be more beneficial.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefits of Group Fitness</strong></p>
      <p>
        On the flip side, many people enjoy group fitness for a variety of reasons. Some people
        gravitate toward group sessions because it is the perfect opportunity to meet new people
        and stay motivated during the class. Additionally group training sessions are much more
        affordable with lower hourly rates. Working out with a group of friends can be both a fun
        and empowering experience. Some of the benefits of group fitness include:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
      <p>
        In addition to highly vibrant motivational coaches, within a group setting, you are more
        likely to push yourself because you want to keep up with the people around you. Group
        fitness classes are also a great way to hold yourself accountable for attending class.
      </p>
      <p><strong>New Exercises</strong></p>
      <p>
        In a group fitness session, you have the opportunity to learn new exercises that target
        specific muscles and regions of your body. Group fitness classes often provide a wide
        variety of fresh routines where you can have fun while getting in shape.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>
      <p>
        Within a group fitness setting, you are not only accountable to yourself, you are
        accountable to your instructor and the rest of the class.The feeling that you have let
        the rest of the group down can be a huge motivator for staying committed.
