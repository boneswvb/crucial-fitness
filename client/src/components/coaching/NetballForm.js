          <h3>Netball Training for Aerobic Fitness</h3>
          <sub>By Lorraine Blue Updated May 26, 2018</sub>
          <p>
            A netball match lasts for 60 minutes, broken down into 15-minute
            quarters with a few brief rest breaks in between. To make it through
            each quarter, and the entire game, a netball player needs a high
            level of aerobic fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interval training, speed training, circuit training and drills can
            help a netball player improve both cardiovascular fitness and
            game-specific skills.
          </p>
          <h2>Interval Training</h2>
          <p>
            Interval training involves completing bouts of intense exercise
            followed by periods of recovery at a lower intensity. The ration of
            work to recovery is dependent on the aim of the training session.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you&#39;re training for aerobic fitness for netball,
            you would work hard for about two to three minutes and recover for a
            brief period of 30 to 60 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players can complete intervals on the court. A session might include
            running lengths of the netball court for a set time, such as two
            minutes, followed by a 30- to 60-second walk. The intervals would be
            repeated several times.
          </p>
          <h3>Fartlek Runs</h3>
          <p>
            Fartlek is the Swedish word for &quot;speed play.&quot; This type of
            training is particularly effective for netball players, because it
            combines a range of training speeds and intensities, which is what
            different positions use during a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fartlek is a combination of sprints, jogs and walks in succession
            continued for a prolonged period such as 20 minutes. Using the
            netball lines, normally the outside lines, the course can consist of
            jogging along one sideline, walking the end line, sprinting the
            opposite sideline and walking the end line to the beginning in a box
            formation.
          </p>
          <h3>Circuit Training</h3>
          <p>
            Circuit training improves cardiovascular fitness and builds
            strength. This type of training consists of several different
            stations, which players will work their way around. Players stay at
            each station for a period of time, typically 45 seconds to 2
            minutes, after which there is a brief period of rest before moving
            on to the next station.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each station can include either a fitness exercise or a
            sport-specific movement. An example of stations might be: sit-ups,
            push-ups, shuttle runs, netball shooting, passing and footwork
            practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Netball Drills</h3>
          <p>
            Part of every netball training session should include some specific
            drills that improve the player&#39;s skills in passing, shooting,
            stable body positioning, catching, footwork, dodging, pivoting and
            forward movement. Performing these drills with intensity will
            naturally improve aerobic fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of an aerobically challenging shooter drill involves two
            players. Player 1 positions the ball in the semi-circle at one end
            of the court. Player 2 runs from the ball to touch the sideline of
            the court, then runs back to the ball, picks it up and shoots it.
            Player 1 retrieves the ball, places it anywhere in the semi-circle
            and player 2 repeats the drill. The goal is for player 2 to get 10
            shots in as little time as possible.
          </p>
          <h3>How to get fit for Netball</h3>
          <p>
            The quickest and best way to get fit for netball is by using a
            combination of lifting weights and Fartlek/interval training.
            Netball is a very stop and start sport so there is little point
            training by running at the same speed for 30 minutes as you would
            never run at the same speed for 30 minutes in a netball game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lifting weights, whether in the gym or wherever you can find the
            space, time and suitable weights (which do not have to be
            traditional dumb bells) is a great way to burn fat and improve
            strength. Resistance or weight lifting combined with cardio-vascular
            training is the best way to lift your fitness ready for netball.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fartlek training can be as hard or as easy as you like, but
            basically it involves changing the speed at which you train
          </p>
          <p>
            Fartlek can be done anywhere which is safe outside or securely in
            the gym. If you are on a treadmill do have the incline on 1 or 2 to
            replicate the effects of running outside.
          </p>
          <h3>Maintaining Health Improving Fitness</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Frequency</strong>
            &nbsp;- 5 time per week or 3 time per week
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Intensity</strong>
            &nbsp;- Moderate to Vigorous
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Times</strong>
            &nbsp;- more than 30 minutes or more than 20 minutes
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Type</strong>
            &nbsp;- Rhythmical movement of large muscles
          </p>
          <h3>Warm up</h3>
          <p>
            You should always warm up before exercise. The aim of warming up is
            to raise the body temperature and heart rate by using all muscle
            groups in a controlled rhythmical activity. Netballpost.com
            recommends using a bike, running or rower for at least 5 minutes
            followed by whole body stretching).
          </p>
          <h3>Cool Down</h3>
          <p>
            This is simply helping your body to return to a normal relaxed
            state. This is normally achieved by static stretching. Stretches
            should be held for at least 15 seconds on each major muscle group.
          </p>
          <h3>Fartlek or Interval training</h3>
          <p>
            Fartlek training is a great way to exercise as in netballpost.com’s
            mind it is not boring as you are continually changing your speed.
            You can do interval training on a bike, running or on a rowing
            machine or anything that changes speed. Spin classes in a gym are a
            controlled way to interval train where you may work harder as you
            are in class.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exercising using interval training you will be chasing the minute
            when you can change your speed and therefore adding variety to your
            exercise. Initially start Fartlek/interval training for 20 minutes.
            You will soon be able to extend the time for longer as you will be
            amazed how quickly you improve. Start with a 1 minute walk, a 1
            minute jog then 1 minute sprint. As time goes on you can always work
            harder so your rest time becomes less.
          </p>
          <h3>Weights</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              You need to remember a few things when lifting weights.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must promote muscular balance across your body as muscles work
            in matching opposites. For example, if you work your biceps then
            make sure you also work your triceps. If you don’t work your muscles
            in pairs, you can get muscle imbalances which can cause injury and
            badly affect your posture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Train your larger muscles first, as this allows you to get a better
            workout as the larger muscles use more energy to train effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perform more complex weight lifting exercises first. Exercises that
            require you to use more than one joint of your body should be
            completed first as they also require lots of energy and
            co-ordination. Better to do larger muscles and multi joint lifting
            first when you are fresh and have lots of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The human body is an amazing thing and it adapts very quickly, so
            remember to change your training and don’t do the same weight
            lifting exercise for too long. Make sure you vary things like the
            number of sets, muscles worked and recovery periods between sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are in a gym ask the gym instructors to show you how to use a
            Swiss ball or Fit ball to lift free weights. As shown in this
            photograph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, if you use weights properly you will increase your fitness
            and strength. You will not look like a muscle bound body builder if
            you use weights properly alongside a good cardio vascular based
            exercise such as netball.
