            Fitter teams win more games – it’s as simple as that. Of course, we
            know that most clubs will not have a fitness trainer or a
            well-equipped gym. But there is a lot you can do yourself. Whether
            you are a player or a coach we have lots of exercises designed
            specifically to improve your training and get you rugby fit. The
            fitness and conditioning drills in this section look at how you can
            help your players to get fit, stay fit, avoid injury and recover
            more quickly, take a look to see the impact it can have on your
            training. How many times have you seen a close game decided in the
            last 10 minutes because one team is fit and the other is running out
            of energy?
            <br />
            <strong>Don’t be a part of that losing team!</strong>
            <br />
            Working on fitness is something every rugby player can do to improve
            results for their team.

            Rugby Fitness Training: The Ultimate Guide To Get Fitter For Rugby
          </h2>
          <p>
            Programming for rugby fitness training is one of the most
            challenging but also enjoyable tasks in sport. Why? Because the
            demands of a rugby player are so far reaching that you need good
            levels of all fitness qualities. You also have athletes of all
            shapes and sizes with differing fitness demands depending on
            position. It’s a challenge but it is also stimulating to be able to
            use a variety of fitness training methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other challenge is that no one athlete responds the same to a
            training approach. So you need a large toolbox of fitness training
            methods and understand which to use with each athlete at the right
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this rugby fitness guide is to teach you everything
            you need to know to get yourself or your players fitter for rugby.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Before we discuss fitness training:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re going to share with you some awesome rugby fitness training
            methods shortly, but before we do it’s important you understand some
            prerequisites that will determine how effective your rugby fitness
            training turns out to be. If you get these things right you will
            reap the benefits of your fitness training, recover quicker, adapt
            better and avoid injuries.
          </p>
          <h3>Nutrition</h3>
          <p>
            You’ve probably heard this before: “You wouldn’t put diesel in a
            Ferrari”. And it’s right, if you want to get the most out of your
            fitness then you need to fuel well. Make sure you’re getting the
            right balance of macronutrients, especially Carbohydrates which are
            important for fuelling high intensity activities like rugby fitness
            training and playing.
          </p>
          <h3>Hydration</h3>
          <p>
            Hydration not only effects your performance in games and during
            fitness training sessions, but it also effects your ability to adapt
            and recovery between them. Make sure you take your hydration
            seriously. Aim for at least 3-4 litres a day and isotonic drinks
            during intense fitness
            <br />
            training and games.
          </p>
          <h3>Sleep</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep is your number one form of recovery. In fact cryotherapy;
            which has often been hailed as a great recovery modality is thought
            to be effective due to it’s impact on sleep! There is also research
            out there showing that less than eight hours of sleep increases risk
            of injury and injury stops you from training to increase your
            fitness. Aim for 8 hours a night and if training really hard try and
            get a power nap in too.
          </p>
          <h2>3 Things that will get you fitter indirectly:</h2>
          <h3>Strength Training</h3>
          <p>
            Strength should be a huge priority for a rugby player. Strength is
            not only needed to dominate the physical collisions in the game but
            also as the foundation for all other physical fitness qualities that
            are important for rugby. Strength development is important for
            improving speed, power and fitness for rugby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research has even shown that rugby players who have a stronger squat
            perform more high intensity work in a game. Not only that, despite
            doing more in the game they also recover faster between games. If
            you want to get fitter for rugby, you need to get stronger.
          </p>
          <h3>Plyometric Training </h3>
          <p>
            Plyometric training is mainly considered as a speed and power
            training modality. But it also has a profound effect on fitness and
            injury prevention. Improving your plyometric ability makes you more
            energy efficient ie. It takes less energy for each foot strike you
            make. If you think about how many foot strikes you make in a game ou
            can potentially save a huge amount of energy by improving your
            plyometric ability.
          </p>
          <h3>Body Composition</h3>
          <p>
            Improving your body composition is an easy way to increase not only
            fitness but also speed. It’s simple really, if you decrease fat
            mass, the weight that offers no functional or contractile benefit,
            you will improve fitness scores and be able to cover the ground
            quicker. If you don’t believe us try running round the pitch for a
            while with a 10kg weight vest on!
          </p>
          <p>
            Improving these three factors will help massively to get you fitter
            for rugby and should be a priority in your rugby strength and
            conditioning program. Once you’ve got these covered however you need
            to really consider your rugby fitness training…
          </p>
          <h2>Rugby Fitness Training The Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Before you can decide what type of fitness training you need to do
            to improve your rugby performance, you need to understand some of
            the basics of physiology we’ll start with the energy systems.
          </p>
          <h3>ATP-PC</h3>
          <p>
            This energy system provides energy rapidly from the ATP-CP stores in
            the cell. They ypically provide energy for 5-15 seconds of high
            intensity activity. It is one of the two anaerobic energy systems,
            which requires no oxygen.
          </p>
          <h3>Glycolytic</h3>
          <p>
            This energy system generates ATP from glycolysis; the breakdown of
            glucose. It can provide energy for 20 secs -2mins and again is
            anaerobic. A by product of glycolysis is lactic acid and hydrogen
            ions. I’m sure you’ve felt the effects of this after a tough fitness
            session when your legs feel heavy!
          </p>
          <h3>Aerobic</h3>
          <p>
            The aerobic energy system requires oxygen to generate ATP and uses
            protein and carbohydrates but predominantly fat. The aerobic energy
            system supports long duration low intensity activities. But more
            importantly for rugby fitness the aerobic system is important for
            recovery between high intensity bouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to understand that the energy systems never work in
            isolation, they are all being used at varying degrees throughout
            exercise. You should also understand that the intensity of the
            exercise you perform and the work:rest ratios you use dictate to a
            great extent which energy systems get used.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you look at the energy systems you should see the need for all
            to be trained to get the most out of your rugby fitness training and
            how you train will dictate which energy systems you stimulate.
          </p>
          <h2>Work:Rest Ratios for rugby fitness training</h2>
          <p>
            <i>
              <strong>“It ain’t what you do, it’s how you do it!”</strong>
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are going to show some great rugby fitness training methods but
            it is imperative that you understand that you could employ anyone of
            these methods but if you don’t use it right you won’t get optimal
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s an example; you want to get faster and be able to repeat it
            for the duration of a rugby match so you perform repeat 100m
            sprints. This could be a good training approach but you use short
            30s rest periods which doesn’t allow enough recovery for you to
            perform them at enough intensity to stimulate the adaptations you
            desire. In fact it will end up turning into an aerobic fitness
            session!
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is you can perform any type of exercise to get fitter for
            rugby but it is the work:rest ratios that determine whether it is
            the type of fitness you are targeting.
