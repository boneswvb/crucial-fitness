          <p>
            Fitter teams win more games – it’s as simple as that. Of course, we know that most clubs
            will not have a fitness trainer or a well-equipped gym.
            But there is a lot you can do yourself. Whether you are a player or a coach we have lots
            of exercises designed specifically to improve your training and get you rugby fit.
            The fitness and conditioning drills in this section look at how you can help your
            players to get fit, stay fit, avoid injury and recover more quickly, take a look to see
            the impact it can have on your training.
            How many times have you seen a close game decided in the last 10 minutes because one
            team is fit and the other is running out of energy?
            <br />
            <strong>Don’t be a part of that losing team!</strong>
            <br />
            Working on fitness is something every rugby player can do to improve results for their
            team.

          <h2>Rugby Fitness Training: The Ultimate Guide To Get Fitter For Rugby</h2>
          <p>
            Programming for rugby fitness training is one of the most challenging but also
            enjoyable tasks in sport. Why? Because the demands of a rugby player are so far
            reaching that you need good levels of all fitness qualities. You also have athletes
            of all shapes and sizes with differing fitness demands depending on position. It’s
            a challenge but it is also stimulating to be able to use a variety of fitness
            training methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other challenge is that no one athlete responds the same to a training
            approach. So you need a large toolbox of fitness training methods and understand
            which to use with each athlete at the right time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this rugby fitness guide is to teach you everything you need to know
            to get yourself or your players fitter for rugby.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Before we discuss fitness training:</strong></p>
          <p>
            We’re going to share with you some awesome rugby fitness training methods shortly,
            but before we do it’s important you understand some prerequisites that will determine
            how effective your rugby fitness training turns out to be. If you get these things
            right you will reap the benefits of your fitness training, recover quicker, adapt
            better and avoid injuries.
          </p>
          <h3>Nutrition</h3>
          <p>
            You’ve probably heard this before: “You wouldn’t put diesel in a Ferrari”. And it’s
            right, if you want to get the most out of your fitness then you need to fuel well.
            Make sure you’re getting the right balance of macronutrients, especially
            Carbohydrates which are important for fuelling high intensity activities like rugby
            fitness training and playing.
          </p>
          <h3>Hydration</h3>
          <p>
            Hydration not only effects your performance in games and during fitness training
            sessions, but it also effects your ability to adapt and recovery between them. Make sure
            you take your hydration seriously. Aim for at least 3-4 litres a day and isotonic drinks
            during intense fitness
            <br />
            training and games.
          </p>
          <h3>Sleep</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep is your number one form of recovery. In fact cryotherapy; which has often been
            hailed as a great recovery modality is thought to be effective due to it’s impact on
            sleep! There is also research out there showing that less than eight hours of sleep
            increases risk of injury and injury stops you from training to increase your
            fitness. Aim for 8 hours a night and if training really hard try and get a power
            nap in too.
          </p>
          <h2>3 Things that will get you fitter indirectly:</h2>
          <h3>Strength Training</h3>
          <p>
            Strength should be a huge priority for a rugby player. Strength is not only needed to
            dominate the physical collisions in the game but also as the foundation for all other
            physical fitness qualities that are important for rugby. Strength development is
            important for improving speed, power and fitness for rugby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research has even shown that rugby players who have a stronger squat perform more
            high intensity work in a game. Not only that, despite doing more in the game they
            also recover faster between games. If you want to get fitter for rugby, you need to
            get stronger.
          </p>
          <h3>Plyometric Training </h3>
          <p>
            Plyometric training is mainly considered as a speed and power training modality. But
            it also has a profound effect on fitness and injury prevention. Improving your
            plyometric ability makes you more energy efficient ie. It takes less energy for each
            foot strike you make. If you think about how many foot strikes you make in a game
            ou can potentially save a huge amount of energy by improving your plyometric ability.
          </p>
          <h3>Body Composition</h3>
          <p>
            Improving your body composition is an easy way to increase not only fitness but also
            speed. It’s simple really, if you decrease fat mass, the weight that offers no
            functional or contractile benefit, you will improve fitness scores and be able to cover
            the ground quicker. If you don’t believe us try running round the pitch for a while
            with a 10kg weight vest on!
          </p>
          <p>
            Improving these three factors will help massively to get you fitter for rugby and
            should be a priority in your rugby strength and conditioning program. Once you’ve got
            these covered however you need to really consider your rugby fitness training…
          </p>
          <h2>Rugby Fitness Training The Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Before you can decide what type of fitness training you need to do to improve your
            rugby performance, you need to understand some of the basics of physiology we’ll
            start with the energy systems.
          </p>
          <h3>ATP-PC</h3>
          <p>
            This energy system provides energy rapidly from the ATP-CP stores in the cell. They
            ypically provide energy for 5-15 seconds of high intensity activity. It is one of
            the two anaerobic energy systems, which requires no oxygen.
          </p>
          <h3>Glycolytic</h3>
          <p>
            This energy system generates ATP from glycolysis; the breakdown of glucose. It can
            provide energy for 20 secs -2mins and again is anaerobic. A by product of glycolysis
            is lactic acid and hydrogen ions. I’m sure you’ve felt the effects of this after a
            tough fitness session when your legs feel heavy!
          </p>
          <h3>Aerobic</h3>
          <p>
            The aerobic energy system requires oxygen to generate ATP and uses protein and
            carbohydrates but predominantly fat. The aerobic energy system supports long duration
            low intensity activities. But more importantly for rugby fitness the aerobic system
            is important for recovery between high intensity bouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to understand that the energy systems never work in isolation, they are
            all being used at varying degrees throughout exercise. You should also understand that
            the intensity of the exercise you perform and the work:rest ratios you use dictate to
            a great extent which energy systems get used.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you look at the energy systems you should see the need for all to be trained to get
            the most out of your rugby fitness training and how you train will dictate which energy
            systems you stimulate.
          </p>
          <h2>Work:Rest Ratios for rugby fitness training</h2>
          <p><i><strong>“It ain’t what you do, it’s how you do it!”</strong></i></p>
          <p>
            We are going to show some great rugby fitness training methods but it is imperative
            that you understand that you could employ anyone of these methods but if you don’t
            use it right you won’t get optimal results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s an example; you want to get faster and be able to repeat it for the duration of
            a rugby match so you perform repeat 100m sprints. This could be a good training
            approach but you use short 30s rest periods which doesn’t allow enough recovery for
            you to perform them at enough intensity to stimulate the adaptations you desire. In
            fact it will end up turning into an aerobic fitness session!
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is you can perform any type of exercise to get fitter for rugby but it is
            the work:rest ratios that determine whether it is the type of fitness you are targeting.
