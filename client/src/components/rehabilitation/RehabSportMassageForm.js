          <h2>What is Sport Massage?</h2>
          <sub><a href="https://www.webmd.com/" target="blank">Info from WebMD</a></sub>
          <p>
            It is massage developed to help with your muscle systems used for a particular sport,
            sports massage uses a variety of approaches to help athletes in training-- before,
            during, or after sports events. You might use it to promote flexibility and help prevent
            injuries. Or, it may help muscle strains, aiding healing after a sports injury.
          </p>
          <h4>Benefits</h4>
          <p>
            Sports massage is a generic term for three different types of massage associated with
            athletic performance.Each type of massage has its own benefits and uses different
            techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pre - event sports massage is done to help prevent serious athletic injury. It helps
            to warm up the muscles, stretching them and making them flexible for optimal athletic
            performance.A pre - event massage stimulates the flow of blood and nutrients to the
            muscles, reduces muscle tension, loosens the muscles, and produces a feeling of
            psychological readiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever athletes exercise heavily, their muscles suffer microtraumas.Small amounts
            of swelling occur in the muscle because of tiny tears. Post - event sports massage
            helps reduce the swelling caused by microtraumas; loosens tired, stiff muscles; helps
            maintain flexibility; promotes blood flow to the muscle to remove lactic acid and waste
            build - up; and reduces cramping.In addition, post - event massage helps speed the
            athlete&apos;s recovery time and alleviates pulls, strains, and soreness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintenance sports massage is done at least once a week as a regular part of athletic
            training programs, although professional athletes who have their own massage therapists
            may have maintenance massage daily. Maintenance massage increases the flow of blood
            and nutrients to the muscles.It also keeps the tissues loose so that different layers
            of muscle slide easily over each other. Maintenance sports massage also helps reduce
            the development of scar tissue while increasing flexibility and range of motion.
          </p>
          <h4>Side effects</h4>
          <p>
            Sports massage is safe and effective. When given correctly, there are no undesirable
            side effects.
          </p>
          <h4>Research & general acceptance</h4>
          <p>
            Sports massage has become an established and accepted practice. Various studies done in
            both the United States and Europe have shown that when properly used, massage will
            produce greater blood flow to the muscles and better athletic performance.
            The practice of sports massage is not considered controversial.
