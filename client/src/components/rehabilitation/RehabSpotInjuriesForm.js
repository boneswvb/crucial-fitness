          <p>
            Sports Injury Rehabilitation is a multi-disciplinary approach to the
            prevention, evaluation, and treatment of injuries. The first step
            towards recovery is getting an accurate diagnosis from a certified
            sports-injury specialist or your health care practitionar.
            Typically, the initial stage of treatment involves reducing pain and
            promoting healing.

        <h4>How it Works:</h4>
        <p>
          Typically, the initial stage of treatment involves reducing pain and
          promoting healing. Once pain and swelling are reduced, progressive
          reconditioning treatment will begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercises will be prescribed to target specific goals such as
          mobility, flexibility training, coordination of balance and joint
          positioning. As progress is made, the athlete and trainer can work
          together towards re-establishing strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to providing state-of-the-art clinical care for
          athletes of all ages and skill levels. Although you may be injured,
          you can still stay in shape, and can use the injury period as an
          opportunity to strengthen other areas of the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A personal, committed investment in healing is a strategy that will
          help you regain optimal performance.
